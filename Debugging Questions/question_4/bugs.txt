1. The getBooksByAuthor method is case-sensitive and may not return the expected results if the author's name is not exactly matched.
2. The getBooksByPriceRange method may not include books with prices that are exactly equal to the minimum or maximum price.
3. The Library class does not handle the case where a book with the same title and author already exists in the library.

1. The getDepartment method in the University class may return null if the department is not found. This could lead to a NullPointerException if the returned department is used without checking for null.
2. The addCourse method in the Department class does not check if the course already exists in the department. This could lead to duplicate courses in the department.
3. The printCourses method in the Student class does not handle the case where the student has no courses.
4. The getCourseName and getCourseCredits functions in the Course class are not used correctly in the Main class.

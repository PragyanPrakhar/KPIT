-> Application :-> It is a program designed for a specific purpose which is used by the end customers 
 and it does not require developer knowledge to use.
-> Libraties :->  Software design for other developers to use and make new products based on the library.
    1) opencsv libraries:-> Developers can use this library to make csv reading software.
-> Framework :->  It is a set of pre-written code that can be used to build applications.

=> Example -> we want to make simple calculator.
>> Java version 8 -> Functional Programming
void performOperation(data , logic){
    logic(data);
}
performOperation(10,square_Of_Number); //100
performOperation(10,cube_Of_Number);   //1000


>> Study About Functinal Interfaces.
>> Predicate is a type that takes one input and return true or false as output.
>> Functional Programming 
   -> Focus on using functions as objects.

>> Java 8 and above have many features for this 
   a) Functional Interfaces(9 built-in types) and @FunctionalInterface to make more efficient.
   b)lambda objects 
     >> Function<Integer,Integer> fn=x->x+10;

   c)functional composition:
     actions on output from previous step /chained function where each function 
    filter----> map-->sum()
    
    stream API of java has features to write composed functions
    >> filter()-->map()-->sum() 
    map:take a logic(written as lambda object / expressions and "apply" on data)
